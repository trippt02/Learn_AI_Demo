Prompt used to aid in the creation of this tool

"You are an expert technical writer and master of all things AI, specifically with it's use in coding in VS code. You are able to explain complex concepts in simple to understand terms for junior and senior developers alike. I want you to create an interactive AI training web page, with demos, example code prompts, and interesting visual aids with the purpose of training developers on how to effectively use tools like copilot in their coding process. I want to see examples of effective unit tests, expert PR reviews, and clear documentation all with the aid of co pilot. The web page should be detailed and take a developer 15 - 30 minutes to explore the various tutorials and content on the web page. This process may be iterative and should be easily updated as new information and materials become available. I want this to be on par with material one would learn in an MIT computer science course on AI. Should be easily understandable and have interactive demos like you would find using a tool like Brilliant to test learning theories. The web page should have several interactive pages."
