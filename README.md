# Learn AI Demo: AI-Powered Coding Mastery

This project is an interactive learning platform designed to teach developers how to effectively use AI tools like GitHub Copilot in their coding workflows. It covers various modules, including understanding AI, mastering prompts, unit testing, PR reviews, documentation, and best practices.

## Features
- **Interactive Modules:** Each `.html` file represents a module with detailed explanations, examples, and interactive demos.
- **Quizzes:** Test your knowledge with quizzes embedded in the modules.
- **AI Documentation Assistant:** Simulated AI tools for generating inline comments, function summaries, and code explanations.
- **Dynamic Content:** JavaScript-powered features like quizzes and interactive demos.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/learn-ai-demo.git
   cd learn-ai-demo
   ```
2. Open the project in your code editor or directly in your browser:
   - To open in a browser, double-click on any `.html` file.
   - For a better experience, serve the project using a local web server.

### Running the Project
- Open `index.html` to start the training modules.
- Navigate through the modules using the navigation bar.

## Modules Overview
1. **Understanding AI (`understanding-ai.html`):** Learn the basics of AI code assistants, how they work, and their benefits and limitations.
2. **Prompt Mastery (`prompt-mastery.html`):** Master the art of crafting effective prompts for AI tools.
3. **Unit Testing (`unit-testing-ai.html`):** Explore how AI can assist in generating and improving unit tests.
4. **PR Reviews (`pr-reviews-ai.html`):** Learn how AI can help with pull request reviews and code quality checks.
5. **Documentation (`documentation-ai.html`):** Discover how AI can generate clear and concise documentation for your code.
6. **Best Practices (`best-practices.html`):** Consolidate best practices for working with AI and explore the future of AI in software development.

## Key Features in Each Module
- **Quizzes:** Test your understanding of the concepts covered in each module.
- **Interactive Demos:** Simulate AI-powered tools for tasks like generating documentation or debugging code.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Receive instant feedback on quiz answers and interactive demo inputs.

## Simulated AI Features
The project includes a simulated "DocuBot" in the `documentation-ai.html` module:
- **Inline Comments:** Automatically add comments to clarify code.
- **Function Summaries:** Generate docstrings or summaries for functions.
- **Code Explanations:** Provide natural language explanations for code snippets.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the `.html` files to add your own examples, quizzes, or interactive features. The JavaScript files (`js/main.js`, `js/interactive-demos.js`) can also be extended to include additional functionality.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new modules or features, feel free to submit a pull request.

Prompt used to aid in the creation of this tool

"You are an expert technical writer and master of all things AI, specifically with it's use in coding in VS code. You are able to explain complex concepts in simple to understand terms for junior and senior developers alike. I want you to create an interactive AI training web page, with demos, example code prompts, and interesting visual aids with the purpose of training developers on how to effectively use tools like copilot in their coding process. I want to see examples of effective unit tests, expert PR reviews, and clear documentation all with the aid of co pilot. The web page should be detailed and take a developer 15 - 30 minutes to explore the various tutorials and content on the web page. This process may be iterative and should be easily updated as new information and materials become available. I want this to be on par with material one would learn in an MIT computer science course on AI. Should be easily understandable and have interactive demos like you would find using a tool like Brilliant to test learning theories. The web page should have several interactive pages."
